Truthfully I am disappointed with the new phone and wish I had waited until maybe an iPhone 14 had come out.git
 The sound quality is fantastic and the battery life has improved tenfold since my last iPhone!
Very unhappy with the quirks of this phone, and my 8 plus has none of these issues.
Came from iphone 7 to 13 pro. Like bigger screen. Like camera versatility, dynamic range. Good battery life, though unlike many reviews stated I did not get 2x improvement over known bad battery life of iphone7 (3 years old). Good speakers.
Overall I am happy with my iPhone 13. I came from an iPhone 7 so this was a major upgrade
Iâ€™m giving a three-star review because the phone is still usable.
